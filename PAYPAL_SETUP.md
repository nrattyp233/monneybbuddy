# PayPal Integration Setup Guide

## Problem Identified
Your MoneyBuddy app was missing the PayPal Supabase Edge Functions required for real money transactions. This is why no actual transactions were happening - the app was calling non-existent functions.

## What Was Added
I've created all the missing PayPal integration functions:

### 1. `/supabase/functions/create-paypal-order/`
- Handles creating PayPal orders for money transfers
- Used when sending money to other users

### 2. `/supabase/functions/claim-transaction/`
- Handles claiming conditional transactions (geo-fence/time restrictions)
- Validates location and time constraints before allowing claims

### 3. `/supabase/functions/create-lock-payment/`
- Creates PayPal orders for locked savings deposits
- Handles the "Lock" savings feature

### 4. `/supabase/functions/process-lock-withdrawal/`
- Processes withdrawals from locked savings via PayPal Payouts
- Handles early withdrawal penalties (10%)

## Required Environment Variables
You need to set these in your Supabase project settings:

```bash
# PayPal Configuration
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_paypal_client_secret
PAYPAL_API_URL=https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com  # Use sandbox for testing
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173  # Your frontend URL

# Supabase (already configured)
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Setup Steps

### 1. Deploy the Functions
```bash
# Deploy all functions to Supabase
supabase functions deploy create-paypal-order
supabase functions deploy claim-transaction
supabase functions deploy create-lock-payment
supabase functions deploy process-lock-withdrawal
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
Go to your Supabase dashboard → Project Settings → Edge Functions → Environment Variables and add the PayPal credentials.

### 3. Apply Database Migrations
```bash
# Apply the withdrawal columns migration
supabase db push
```

### 4. Get PayPal Credentials
1. Go to https://developer.paypal.com/
2. Create a sandbox application
3. Get your Client ID and Client Secret
4. Use sandbox URL: `https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com`

### 5. Test the Integration
- Try sending money between users
- Test the locked savings feature
- Verify conditional transactions work

## What This Enables
- ✅ **Real Money Transfers**: Send money via PayPal
- ✅ **Locked Savings**: Lock money for specific periods
- ✅ **Conditional Payments**: Geo-fence and time-restricted transfers
- ✅ **Withdrawal Processing**: Get money back from locked savings
- ✅ **Early Withdrawal Penalties**: Automatic 10% penalty calculation

## Security Features
- All functions validate user authentication
- Row-level security prevents unauthorized access
- PayPal handles actual money movement securely
- Geo-fence validation for conditional payments

## Next Steps
1. Set up PayPal developer account
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy the functions
4. Test with small amounts in sandbox mode
5. Switch to production PayPal when ready

Your app now has full PayPal integration for real money transactions!
